### TODO

 -- What's wrong with topic `johncmerfeld`?
 -- Logging to files! / mongo?
 -- Branch for "tutorial version"
 -- more in application properties, less in code
 -- Indicate when message has been sent

1. Create custom consumer (new endpoint for consuming topics!!)
2. Explore deeper producer behavior
3. Learn more about what's going on here (and write about it!) / explain what the init-spring script is for
